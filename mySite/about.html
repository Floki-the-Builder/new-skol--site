  <p >I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. From a young age I showed interest in technology  and combat sports. I have two siblings. My youngest (<b>male</b>)
      recently graduated college with a <i> <ins> Computer Science degree.</ins></i><br> I competed in <ins>Combat Sports</ins> as a teenager. I didn't know it <br> then, but I would end up making a career <br> out of it. </p>

  <h3> <ins> Military Career </ins></h3>
  <img style="height: 50vh;" src="pics/Screen Shot 2022-05-02 at 2.50.46 PM.png" alt="military">
  <p>Since I can remember,<br> I wanted to be an <i><b>Infantry Man</b></i>. I joinded at 19 years old. After basic training it would be 5 months before deploying to <i>Afghanistan</i> June 29 2011.  </p> 
      
  <h3><ins>Fight Career</ins></h3>
  <img style="height: 50vh;" src="pics/IMG_2786.jpg" alt="fight">
  <p>Fighting has always been part of my being. Growing up in <b>combat sports</b> or fighting in <mark>Afghanistan.</mark> When I got back I needed and outlet to help me stay ZEN. I went back to my competitive fight roots. It has given me the oppotunity to travel all over the world. Is as important as H<sub>2</sub>O in my life.</p>

  <h3><ins>Why Coding?</ins></h3> 
  <img style="height: 50vh;" src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/goku-learning-react-2.png" alt="coding-goku">
  <p>During <b>COVID</b> I lost my job. I had enough money to stay home and acquire a new skill. Programing fell into my lap and even tho I am still learning the basics, I naturaly am drawn to it. I enjoy all the posibilities one can create because of it. I have made a few games following along. mostly bc I don't fully <br> get <b><i>JavaScript</i></b>..... <b>Yet,</b> Looking forward to learning and creating in the up coming months.</p>
